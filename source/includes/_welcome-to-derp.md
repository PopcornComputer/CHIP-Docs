# Welcome to The CHIP Operating System

We made a computer. And every computer needs an operating system. 

Ours is The CHIP Operating System. Grab an old TV (or any screen with a composite video input), a keyboard and mouse, and stick some electricity in the micro USB port. In a few seconds, you'll have CHIP's operating system on your screen, ready to do **computer things.**

CHIP is built for making - we've packed a powerful processor, 4 GB of storage, stereo audio, video out,  and lots of connections for playing and making your projects and products. 

The CHIP Operating System is built for doing: browse the 'net, send email, play video games, listen to music, write a novel, watch a video, or learn programming. And because it's based on the popular Linux Debian, if there's something you need, you can probably install it. 

So how do use this thing? Let's get started.
